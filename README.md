# Venture the dungeon

This is a ideia of a game of RPG that simulates a short adventura in a dungeon. As I'm studying more about programming the game wil be updated.

## Initial ideia
At first place, the game will have two classes, a warrior who has more defense than damage and a rogue who has more damage than defense. Each room will have some monsters and a reward to choose if you win. The final boss of the dungeon will be a especific one (no spoilers). 

While I learn more about programming and have new ideias the game will be improved. I already think in a way to randomise the monsters, the rewards, and we will have more dungeons and classes in the future.

## Conclusion

This project is just a way to practice my skills of programming, feel free to give hints and tips about the way that I write my code and feel free to give ideas.
